What the program needs to do: 

1. Determine equipped ilevel
2. Determine ilevel with new item replacing old item. 
3. Determine stats for both ilevels. (Determine which two points given we are between, find stats for current point) 
4. Higher equipped ilevel is good so give + to scoring
5. Determine difference between new item stats and ideal stats at new ilvl. 
6. Determine difference between current stats and ideal stats for current equipment. 
7. Rank stats in order of which stat should be highest. 
8. Create "score" from stat rankings.
